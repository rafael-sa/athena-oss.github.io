        <h2>Athena is an automation platform with a plugin architecture<br>that allows you to easily create and share services.</h2>
        <p>The key to optimize work is to <em>automate</em> as much as possible.
            <br>Whether you are developing software, setting up infrastructure or even testing, if there is a chance to do it just take it.</p>
        <p>Most of the times the boring and frequent tasks can be automated.
            <br>There are a lot of different tools and technologies that can help you with that,
            <br> but sometimes starting is simply an hassle by itself and one might end up giving up and doing it <em>&quot;manually&quot;</em>.</p>
        <p>This is where <strong>Athena</strong> jumps in. The idea is quite simple, we minimize the start process by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>automating the wiring of the dependencies and tools</li>
            <li>implement a plugin architecture to allow freedom and scalability</li>
            <li>throw in a wizard that takes care of the boring stuff</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once that part is done, you can reuse it as much as you can and you can even share with other people or teams.</p><br>
